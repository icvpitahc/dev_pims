# PIMS System Patterns

This document describes the high-level architectural and design patterns employed in the Personnel Information Management System (PIMS).

## Architectural Style

The application follows a standard Laravel monolithic architecture. The frontend is tightly coupled with the backend through the use of Livewire, which allows for dynamic, reactive interfaces without a separate JavaScript framework.

## Key Design Patterns

*   **Livewire Components:** The majority of the user interface is built using Livewire components. This pattern encapsulates the view and its corresponding logic within a single PHP class, simplifying state management and user interactions.
*   **Repository Pattern (Implied):** While not explicitly defined, the use of Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions follows the principles of the repository pattern, abstracting data access from the application's business logic.
*   **Data Tables:** The `rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables` package is used extensively for displaying and managing tabular data. This is a critical component that will require significant attention during the upgrade.
*   **Cascading Soft Deletes:** For critical records like documents, a soft delete strategy is implemented. When a parent record (e.g., `Document`) is soft-deleted, a model event listener triggers the soft deletion of all its children (e.g., `DocumentLog`), ensuring data consistency.
*   **Auditing:** Key models like `Document` and `DocumentLog` implement the `owen-it/laravel-auditing` package. This automatically creates a detailed audit trail for all create, update, and delete operations.

## Component Relationships

*   **`AdminLTE` Theme:** The overall look and feel of the application was originally provided by the `infyomlabs/laravel-ui-adminlte` package. However, a new modernized theme using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS is being implemented, starting with the authentication pages.
*   **Livewire and Blade:** Livewire components are rendered within Blade templates, allowing for a seamless integration of dynamic and static content.

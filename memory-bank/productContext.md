## User Experience Goals

The primary goal of the user experience is to provide a clear, intuitive, and efficient interface for completing administrative tasks. While the application was originally built with the AdminLTE theme, there is an ongoing effort to modernize the user interface with a cleaner, more contemporary design using Bootstrap 5.

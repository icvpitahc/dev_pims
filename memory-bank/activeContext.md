# PIMS Active Context

This document outlines the current focus of development for the Personnel Information Management System (PIMS).

## Current Work

The current task is to begin the process of upgrading the application's dependencies to be compatible with Laravel 9. This involves updating the `composer.json` file and ensuring all packages work correctly with the new versions.

## Recent Accomplishments

*   **Modernized Module Selector:** Successfully redesigned the `module-selector` page with a new card-based layout, hover effects, and updated icons. The styles were consolidated into the component's Blade file for improved maintainability.

## Key Activities

*   **Dependency Analysis:** Reviewing all dependencies in `composer.json` to identify required version updates for Laravel 9.
*   **Update `composer.json`:** Modifying the `composer.json` file with the target versions for each package.
*   **Run Composer Update:** Executing the `composer update` command to install the new package versions.
*   **Resolve Conflicts:** Addressing any dependency conflicts that arise during the update process.

## Decisions and Considerations

*   **No Database Changes:** The database schema will not be altered.
*   **No Page Deletions:** All existing pages will be preserved.
*   **Compatibility-Focused Changes:** All modifications will be made strictly for the purpose of achieving compatibility with Laravel 9.

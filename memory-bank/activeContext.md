# PIMS Active Context

This document outlines the current focus of development for the Personnel Information Management System (PIMS).

## Current Work

The primary focus is now on refactoring the application's Livewire components to ensure they are fully compatible with the updated dependencies, particularly `livewire/livewire` v2.10 and `rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables` v2.0.

## Recent Accomplishments

*   **Set Login as Default Page:** Removed the welcome page and set the login page as the application's default entry point.
*   **Upgraded Dependencies:** Successfully updated all `composer.json` dependencies to be compatible with Laravel 9.
*   **Modernized Registration Page:** Successfully redesigned the registration page with a modern, card-based layout, consistent with the login page.
*   **Modernized Login Page:** Successfully redesigned the login page with a modern, card-based layout, and a dedicated stylesheet for improved maintainability.
*   **Modernized Module Selector:** Successfully redesigned the `module-selector` page with a new card-based layout, hover effects, and updated icons. The styles were consolidated into the component's Blade file for improved maintainability.
*   **Enhanced CSS Form:** Updated the "PITAHC Customer Satisfaction Measurement Form" by changing its title, improving button sizes, and fixing the alignment of dropdown arrows for a cleaner user interface.
*   **Modernized Forgot Password Page:** Successfully redesigned the forgot password page with a modern, card-based layout, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Reset Password Page:** Successfully redesigned the reset password page with a modern, card-based layout, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Newsfeed Page:** Successfully redesigned the newsfeed page (`home.blade.php`) with a modern, card-based layout. The update includes an improved user experience for creating posts via a modal, and the ability to like and comment on posts. The design was further enhanced by replacing profile pictures with dynamically generated user initials for a cleaner, more consistent look.
*   **Implemented Infinite Scroll:** Replaced the traditional pagination on the newsfeed with an infinite scroll feature, allowing users to seamlessly load more posts as they scroll down the page.
*   **Designed Document Tracking Page:** Created a modern, static design for the document tracking page based on the office's monitoring slip, including summary cards, advanced filters, and a detailed document view.
*   **Updated Document Migration:** Modified the `create_documents_table` migration to align with the new design by adding `note` and `document_sub_type_id` fields, and removing the `status_type_id` field.
*   **Created Reference Tables:** Created and migrated new tables for `document_status_types`, `document_types`, and `document_sub_types` to normalize the database structure. The `document_sub_types` table now includes a `document_type_id` to establish a relationship with the `document_types` table.
*   **Created Actions Table:** Created and migrated a new `actions` table to store the different types of actions that can be logged against a document.
*   **Enhanced Document Tracking Module:**
    *   **Creation Modal:** The document creation modal now includes "Forward To" and "Remarks" fields, automatically creating the first routing log upon submission. A Toastr notification now confirms successful creation.
    *   **Dynamic Table:** The main table is now fully dynamic, displaying a paginated list of documents with color-coded rows based on their status (Pending, Ongoing, Completed, Discarded).
    *   **New Columns & Actions:** Added "Location" and "Status" columns with custom logic. The "Actions" column now includes view, edit, and delete icon buttons.
    *   **View Modal:** The detailed "Document Monitoring Slip" has been moved into a modal, which is triggered by the view button and displays a QR code for the tracking number.
    *   **Reference Code:** The logic for the `document_reference_code` has been updated to be sequential per year and division.
    *   **Model Relationships:** Added multiple new relationships to the `Document` and `DocumentLog` models to support the new features.
    *   **Corrected Action Workflow:** Refactored the logic in the action modal to correctly implement a two-step process. Users must now click a "Receive" button before the "Take Action" form is displayed, ensuring the workflow is followed correctly.
    *   **Timestamped Documents:** Updated the document tracking page to display both the date and time for all document-related timestamps, providing more precise tracking information.
    *   **Functional Search:** Implemented a search feature on the document tracking page that allows users to filter documents by their tracking number or title in real-time.
    *   **Corrected Advanced Filtering:** Aligned the "Ongoing" status filter with the summary card logic to ensure consistency. Also corrected the "Office of Origin" filter to include all divisions.
    *   **Accurate Summary Cards:** Refactored the summary card queries to be based on all documents involving the user's division (created, sent, or received), not just those they created. Added a new "Total Documents Involved" card to reflect this complete count.
    *   **Improved Location Logic:** The "Current Location" for completed or discarded documents now correctly shows the last division that handled it, instead of "N/A".
    *   **Printable View:** Implemented a printable version of the Document Monitoring Slip, complete with a print button and A4-optimized styling.
    *   **Public Document View:** Implemented a mobile-friendly, public-facing page for viewing a document's history, accessible via a QR code, and a feature for public users to receive documents.
*   **Data Integrity and Auditing:**
    *   **Cascading Soft Deletes:** Implemented a robust soft delete system for documents. When a document is deleted, all of its associated tracking logs are now also soft-deleted.
    *   **User Tracking on Deletes:** The user ID of the person who deleted a document is now recorded on both the document and all of its logs.
    *   **Auditing:** The `Document` and `DocumentLog` models are now fully auditable, tracking all creates, updates, and deletes in the `audits` table.
*   **Strengthened Security:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Added `strip_tags` to the registration process to prevent the storage of malicious HTML.
    *   **IP Address Resolution:** Configured the `TrustProxies` middleware to correctly capture user IP addresses behind a reverse proxy.
*   **XSS Prevention:** Verified that the user list page properly escapes output, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
    *   **Refactored CSS Results Page:** Refactored the "Client Satisfaction Measurement Results" page to use a dedicated controller for API requests, resolving an issue with the graphs not displaying.
    *   **Reviewed User Management:** The `ListUsers` page was reviewed and found to be functional at a basic level, but contains several bugs and inconsistencies, including incorrect filter labels, broken links, and calls to undefined methods. This is likely a result of the ongoing Laravel 9 upgrade and will need to be addressed during the component refactoring phase.
    *   **Manually Updated Schema:** The `documents` table was manually updated to include an `extremely_urgent_id` column to support a new feature for flagging urgent documents.
    *   **Implemented "Extremely Urgent" Feature:**
        *   Added a styled checkbox to the document creation form.
        *   Implemented logic to save the urgent status to the database.
        *   Added a visual indicator (bold, red text) to the main document list for urgent items.
        *   Added a styled "stamp" to the document details modal and the print view to clearly mark urgent documents.

## Key Activities

*   **Component Refactoring:** Systematically reviewing and updating each Livewire component to address breaking changes from the dependency upgrades.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly testing each refactored component to ensure it functions as expected.

## Decisions and Considerations

*   **Database Schema Alignment:** The database schema is being updated to support new features, such as the document tracking module. This includes both formal migrations and occasional manual additions as new requirements are identified.
*   **No Page Deletions:** All existing pages will be preserved.
*   **Compatibility-Focused Changes:** All modifications will be made strictly for the purpose of achieving compatibility with Laravel 9.
*   **Bootstrap 4 Legacy:** It has been identified that the core application layout (`b_app.blade.php`) uses Bootstrap 4 via the AdminLTE theme. While new and modernized pages use Bootstrap 5, a full migration of the core layout has been deferred to a later date due to its complexity. This represents a piece of technical debt that will need to be addressed in the future.

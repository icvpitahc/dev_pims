# PIMS Active Context

This document outlines the current focus of development for the Personnel Information Management System (PIMS).

## Current Work

The primary focus is now on refactoring the application's Livewire components to ensure they are fully compatible with the updated dependencies, particularly `livewire/livewire` v2.10 and `rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables` v2.0.

## Recent Accomplishments

*   **Set Login as Default Page:** Removed the welcome page and set the login page as the application's default entry point.
*   **Upgraded Dependencies:** Successfully updated all `composer.json` dependencies to be compatible with Laravel 9.
*   **Modernized Registration Page:** Successfully redesigned the registration page with a modern, card-based layout, consistent with the login page.
*   **Modernized Login Page:** Successfully redesigned the login page with a modern, card-based layout, and a dedicated stylesheet for improved maintainability.
*   **Modernized Module Selector:** Successfully redesigned the `module-selector` page with a new card-based layout, hover effects, and updated icons. The styles were consolidated into the component's Blade file for improved maintainability.
*   **Enhanced CSS Form:** Updated the "PITAHC Customer Satisfaction Measurement Form" by changing its title, improving button sizes, and fixing the alignment of dropdown arrows for a cleaner user interface.
*   **Modernized Forgot Password Page:** Successfully redesigned the forgot password page with a modern, card-based layout, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Reset Password Page:** Successfully redesigned the reset password page with a modern, card-based layout, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Newsfeed Page:** Successfully redesigned the newsfeed page (`home.blade.php`) with a modern, card-based layout. The update includes an improved user experience for creating posts via a modal, and the ability to like and comment on posts. The design was further enhanced by replacing profile pictures with dynamically generated user initials for a cleaner, more consistent look.
*   **Implemented Infinite Scroll:** Replaced the traditional pagination on the newsfeed with an infinite scroll feature, allowing users to seamlessly load more posts as they scroll down the page.
*   **Designed Document Tracking Page:** Created a modern, static design for the document tracking page based on the office's monitoring slip, including summary cards, advanced filters, and a detailed document view.
*   **Updated Document Migration:** Modified the `create_documents_table` migration to align with the new design by adding `note` and `document_sub_type_id` fields.
*   **Created Reference Tables:** Created and migrated new tables for `document_status_types`, `document_types`, and `document_sub_types` to normalize the database structure.

## Key Activities

*   **Component Refactoring:** Systematically reviewing and updating each Livewire component to address breaking changes from the dependency upgrades.
*   **Testing:** Thoroughly testing each refactored component to ensure it functions as expected.

## Decisions and Considerations

*   **Database Schema Alignment:** The database schema is being updated to support new features, such as the document tracking module.
*   **No Page Deletions:** All existing pages will be preserved.
*   **Compatibility-Focused Changes:** All modifications will be made strictly for the purpose of achieving compatibility with Laravel 9.

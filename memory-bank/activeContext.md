# PIMS Active Context

This document outlines the current focus of development for the Personnel Information Management System (PIMS).

## Current Work

The current task is to modernize the `module-selector` page. This involves updating the layout, improving interactivity, and refreshing the icons to create a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

## Key Activities

*   **Layout Enhancement:** Redesigning the module cards to be more visually engaging.
*   **Interactivity Improvement:** Adding hover effects to the cards for better user feedback.
*   **Icon Modernization:** Replacing existing icons with a more modern and consistent set.
*   **CSS Refinement:** Consolidating styles and removing inline CSS for better maintainability.

## Decisions and Considerations

*   **No Database Changes:** The database schema will not be altered.
*   **No Page Deletions:** All existing pages will be preserved.
*   **Compatibility-Focused Changes:** All modifications will be made strictly for the purpose of achieving compatibility with Laravel 9.

# PIMS Progress

This document tracks the progress of the PIMS Laravel 9 upgrade.

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed the dependency upgrade phase. The current focus is on refactoring all Livewire components to ensure compatibility with the new package versions.

## Completed Tasks

*   **Set Login as Default Page:** The application's root route now redirects to the login page, and the welcome page has been removed.
*   **Upgraded Dependencies:** All dependencies in `composer.json` have been updated for Laravel 9 compatibility.
*   **Modernized Registration Page:** The registration page has been updated with a modern, card-based design, consistent with the login page.
*   **Modernized Login Page:** The login page has been updated with a modern, card-based design and a dedicated stylesheet.
*   **Modernized `module-selector` page:** The module selection interface has been updated with a modern, card-based design and improved interactivity.
*   **Enhanced CSS Form:** The "PITAHC Customer Satisfaction Measurement Form" has been improved with a new title, better button sizing, and corrected dropdown arrow alignment.
*   **Modernized Forgot Password Page:** The forgot password page has been updated with a modern, card-based design, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Reset Password Page:** The reset password page has been updated with a modern, card-based design, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Newsfeed Page:** The newsfeed page (`home.blade.php`) has been updated with a modern, card-based design. This includes a modal for creating posts, like and comment functionality, and the use of user initials as profile picture placeholders for a cleaner interface.
*   **Implemented Infinite Scroll:** The traditional pagination on the newsfeed has been replaced with an infinite scroll feature, allowing for a more seamless user experience.
*   **Designed Document Tracking Page:** Created a modern, static design for the document tracking page based on the office's monitoring slip.
*   **Updated Document Migration:** Aligned the `create_documents_table` migration with the new design by adding `note` and `document_sub_type_id` fields.
*   **Created Reference Tables:** Created and migrated new tables for `document_status_types`, `document_types`, and `document_sub_types` to normalize the database structure.

## What Works

*   The application's dependencies are now compatible with Laravel 9.
*   The application is fully functional on Laravel 8 (pre-upgrade).
*   The registration, login, forgot password, reset password, module-selector, CSS form, and newsfeed pages have been modernized or enhanced.
*   The newsfeed now supports infinite scrolling.
*   The document tracking page design is complete and the corresponding migrations have been created and run.

## What's Left to Build

*   Refactor all Livewire components for Laravel 9 compatibility.
*   Update the core Laravel codebase (e.g., configuration files, bootstrap process).
*   Thoroughly test the application after the upgrade to identify and fix any regressions.

## Known Issues

*   The `rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables` package upgrade to v2.0 is a major change and is expected to cause significant breaking changes in all data tables.

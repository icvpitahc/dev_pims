# PIMS Progress

This document tracks the progress of the PIMS Laravel 9 upgrade.

## Current Status

The project has successfully completed the dependency upgrade phase. The current focus is on refactoring all Livewire components to ensure compatibility with the new package versions.

## Completed Tasks

*   **Set Login as Default Page:** The application's root route now redirects to the login page, and the welcome page has been removed.
*   **Upgraded Dependencies:** All dependencies in `composer.json` have been updated for Laravel 9 compatibility.
*   **Modernized Registration Page:** The registration page has been updated with a modern, card-based design, consistent with the login page.
*   **Modernized Login Page:** The login page has been updated with a modern, card-based design and a dedicated stylesheet.
*   **Modernized `module-selector` page:** The module selection interface has been updated with a modern, card-based design and improved interactivity.
*   **Enhanced CSS Form:** The "PITAHC Customer Satisfaction Measurement Form" has been improved with a new title, better button sizing, and corrected dropdown arrow alignment.
*   **Modernized Forgot Password Page:** The forgot password page has been updated with a modern, card-based design, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Reset Password Page:** The reset password page has been updated with a modern, card-based design, consistent with the login and registration pages.
*   **Modernized Newsfeed Page:** The newsfeed page (`home.blade.php`) has been updated with a modern, card-based design. This includes a modal for creating posts, like and comment functionality, and the use of user initials as profile picture placeholders for a cleaner interface.
*   **Implemented Infinite Scroll:** The traditional pagination on the newsfeed has been replaced with an infinite scroll feature, allowing for a more seamless user experience.
*   **Designed Document Tracking Page:** Created a modern, static design for the document tracking page based on the office's monitoring slip.
*   **Updated Document Migration:** Aligned the `create_documents_table` migration with the new design by adding `note` and `document_sub_type_id` fields, and removing the `status_type_id` field.
*   **Created Reference Tables:** Created and migrated new tables for `document_status_types`, `document_types`, and `document_sub_types` to normalize the database structure. The `document_sub_types` table now includes a `document_type_id` to establish a relationship with the `document_types` table.
*   **Created Actions Table:** Created and migrated a new `actions` table to store the different types of actions that can be logged against a document.
*   **Enhanced Document Tracking Module:** Implemented a fully dynamic and feature-rich document tracking module. This includes a creation modal with integrated routing, a dynamic and color-coded table with status and location tracking, a detailed view modal with a QR code, an edit/action modal for processing pending documents, a functional search bar, and advanced filtering. The document tracking page now also displays both the date and time for all document-related timestamps.
*   **Strengthened Security:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Added `strip_tags` to the registration process to prevent the storage of malicious HTML.
    *   **IP Address Resolution:** Configured the `TrustProxies` middleware to correctly capture user IP addresses behind a reverse proxy.
    *   **XSS Prevention:** Verified that the user list page properly escapes output, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
*   **Enhanced Document Tracking Module (Continued):**
    *   **Dynamic Summary Cards:** Implemented dynamic summary cards with percentages.
    *   **Personalized Document View:** The document list is now filtered based on the user's context.
    *   **Corrected Status Logic:** The logic for the "Ongoing" status has been fixed.
    *   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved a critical bug in the document update process.
    *   **Printable View:** Added a feature to print a clean, A4-formatted Document Monitoring Slip.
    *   **Custom Name Formatting:** Implemented a custom name format for signatures in the routing history.
    *   **Modernized Summary Cards:** Redesigned the summary cards on the document tracking page with a more modern, informative, and interactive layout.
    *   **Implemented Document Receiving Workflow:** Added a new two-step process for receiving and then taking action on documents, including a `received_date` in the `document_logs` table for more precise tracking.
    *   **Enhanced Document Visibility:** Updated the main document list to show all documents that have been routed to or from a user's division, providing a complete history.
    *   **Improved UI Logic:** Refined the conditions for enabling the "Edit" button and displaying the "Current Location" to better reflect the document's state.
    *   **Created Public Document View:** Implemented a mobile-friendly, public-facing page for viewing a document's history, accessible via a QR code.
*   **Added Public Document Receiving:** Implemented a feature to allow public users to receive documents by entering their employee ID number.
*   **Refactored CSS Results Page:** Refactored the "Client Satisfaction Measurement Results" page to use a dedicated controller for API requests, resolving an issue with the graphs not displaying.
*   **Manually Updated Schema:** The `documents` table was manually updated to include an `extremely_urgent_id` column.
*   **Implemented "Extremely Urgent" Feature:** Added a checkbox to the creation form and visual indicators (red/bold text and a stamp) to all relevant views to highlight urgent documents.

## What Works

*   The application's dependencies are now compatible with Laravel 9.
*   The application is fully functional on Laravel 8 (pre-upgrade).
*   The registration, login, forgot password, reset password, module-selector, CSS form, and newsfeed pages have been modernized or enhanced.
*   The newsfeed now supports infinite scrolling.
*   The document tracking module is now fully functional with a dynamic table, creation and view modals, complex status/location logic, timestamped document dates, a functional search bar, and advanced filtering.
*   The summary cards on the document tracking page are now dynamic and filtered.
*   The printable view for the Document Monitoring Slip is fully functional.
*   The `actions` table has been created and migrated.
*   The application is now more secure against injection and XSS attacks.
*   The auditing feature now correctly logs the user's public IP address.
*   The summary cards on the document tracking page have been modernized with a new design and short descriptions.
*   The document receiving workflow is fully functional.
*   The public document view is mobile-friendly and displays the complete routing history.
*   The document list now shows all documents that have interacted with the user's division.
*   The public document receiving feature is fully functional with ID validation and user feedback.
*   The "Client Satisfaction Measurement Results" page is now fully functional.
*   The "Extremely Urgent" document feature is fully functional.

## What's Left to Build

*   Refactor all Livewire components for Laravel 9 compatibility.
*   Update the core Laravel codebase (e.g., configuration files, bootstrap process).
*   Thoroughly test the application after the upgrade to identify and fix any regressions.

## Known Issues

*   The `rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables` package upgrade to v2.0 is a major change and is expected to cause significant breaking changes in all data tables.
*   **Bootstrap 4 Legacy:** The core application layout (`b_app.blade.php`) is dependent on Bootstrap 4 via the AdminLTE theme. This creates a technical debt and a potential obstacle for future UI modernization efforts, as most new pages are being built with Bootstrap 5. A full migration has been deemed high-risk and deferred.
*   **Bugs in User Management:** The `ListUsers` page contains several minor bugs, including incorrect filter labels, broken links (e.g., the "View" button), and calls to undefined methods (e.g., the "Edit" button). These issues need to be addressed as part of the Livewire component refactoring.

# Project Brief: PIMS Laravel 9 Upgrade

The primary objective of this project is to upgrade the Personnel Information Management System (PIMS) from its current Laravel 8 version to Laravel 9. This upgrade is necessary to leverage the latest features, security enhancements, and performance improvements of the Laravel framework.

The project involves a comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase, a careful update of all dependencies, and a thorough refactoring of any components affected by breaking changes, with a particular focus on Livewire components and the `rappasoft/laravel-livewire-tables` package.

All modifications will be strictly for compatibility purposes. No existing pages will be deleted.

**Update:** The project scope has been expanded to include modernizing the user interface and implementing new features in the Document Tracking module, which has required additions to the database schema.
